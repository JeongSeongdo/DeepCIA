###
We present code and data on "A novel deep learning model for the identification of cancer types using class activation mapping via transcription factor expression".


#####
1. TCGA and ICGC files have "Code" and "Preprocessed Data" folders. "Code" presents R codes and MATLAB codes for download and preprocessing processes to individual cancer types. And "Preprocessed Data" provides a preprocessed ".csv file".

#####
2. Network files have "Code" and "Results" folders. "Code" describes the MTALAB code for learning each network and calculation methods such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Also, "Results" provides learned network files.
